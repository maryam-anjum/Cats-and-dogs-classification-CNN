Cats vs Dogs Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images of cats and dogs. The project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques for image recognition tasks.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build a robust image classifier that can distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images of cats and dogs, and the trained model is then evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance.

Features
1) Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to normalize the images and ensure consistency in size and format.
2) Model Architecture: Implementation of a CNN architecture designed for the specific task of binary classification.
3) Training and Validation: The model is trained using data augmentation techniques to improve generalization. The training process includes monitoring the loss and 
accuracy on a validation set to prevent overfitting.
4) Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on a test set to determine its accuracy and other performance metrics.
5) Visualization: Tools and scripts for visualizing the training process, including loss and accuracy curves, and sample predictions.
